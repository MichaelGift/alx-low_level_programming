## Search Algorithms

- Search algorithm - Instruction to retrieve data/information/record in a given data sructure.
- Space complexity - How much memory space is needed for the algorithm to work, the smaller the better.

### Categories of search algorithms
Linear Search - Sequential, goes through the dataset/data structure record by record until it finds the needed information

Binary Search - Splits the dataset/data structure in half until record is found,
usually in a sorted dataset. Also called half interval
